This folder contains the Magma code needed to verify many of the invariant theory computations from my paper "Uniform exponent bounds on primitive extensions of number fields."

The file "find-invariants.mag" contains many of the workhorse functions, described below.  The folder "receipts" contains the verification of the specific computations quoted in the paper, namely the proofs of Lemma 4.19 (which fidnds the minimal invariants of the Mathieu groups) and Theorem 5.8 (which gives bounds on small degree extensions of number fields).
