This folder contains the receipts for most of the computations mentioned in the paper.  
In particular, the file "compute-mathieu-invariants.mag" is the Magma code used to find the invariants for the Mathieu groups presented in Lemma 4.18.
The file "mathieu-invariants-output.txt" contains the output from running that computation on my personal computer.
