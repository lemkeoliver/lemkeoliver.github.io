: .mag: Coded in Magma.  This is a closed-source, non-free computer algebra system with high functionality and its own peculiar syntax.  There is a free online calculator available at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/

: .sage: Coded in Sage.  This is a free, open-source Python based computer algebra system.  It has similar functionality to Magma, but is (unfortunately) not quite as powerful, fast, or complete in many instances.
